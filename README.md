# **PersonaEngine AR HUD**

**An RP-Driven Augmented-Reality Visor System for WoW (Work In Progress)**

PersonaEngine AR HUD is an experimental, roleplay-powered interface overhaul that turns your *transmog*, *helm*, or even specific *toys/buffs* into actual, functional AR visors. When you’re wearing the right gear, your character sees battlefield telemetry: targets light up, distances appear, units get holographic markers, and your whole UI becomes a glowing augmented-reality overlay.

When you remove that visor?
You go **blind** — no player frame, no pet frame, no target or focus panels. Just you, your wits, and the chaos of the world. Exactly like your character suddenly lost their tech.

It’s World of Warcraft played through the eyes of your persona.

This addon is actively being developed. Systems, skins, and item-bound profiles are expanding constantly.

## **The Core Fantasy**

PersonaEngine AR HUD is built for players who treat their character like a person with tools, inventions, and limitations — not just stats. The moment you equip a gizmo, goggles, visor, mechagnome optics, or certain toys/buffs, the HUD *powers on*.
You literally see the world through your character’s tech.

Each visor type can eventually have its own theme, quirks, and visual identity.
Engineer goggles? Industrial orange readouts.
Mage spectacles? Arcane reticles.
Shadowy visor helms? Whisper-thin purple telemetry.

The UI becomes an extension of your roleplay.

## **What You See *With* a Visor Equipped**

**• Full AR Panels (Player, Target, Focus, Pet, Mouseover)**
Clean, holographic data cards float around your screen with health, range, threat, and status.

**• Theo Arrows & Reticles**
Close enemies get reticles with range rings; distant or off-screen ones get directional arrows that feel like a sci-fi sensor sweep.

**• Real-Time Range Detection (LibRangeCheck-Driven)**
Your visor constantly measures distance and adapts in real time — arrows shrink, reticles change state, layouts animate intelligently.

**• Customizable Layout Editor**
Every AR element is draggable and savable. Build a HUD that matches your character’s engineering style.

**• Blizzard UI Suppression**
The visor takes over. When it’s active, Blizzard frames vanish — and restore safely when the visor goes offline.

## **What You See *Without* a Visor**

Basically nothing.
You lose:

* Player frame
* Pet frame
* Target & focus frames
* Mouseover panel
* Most combat awareness

It’s intentionally brutal — because your character has no tech helping them.
It becomes a challenge mode, an RP mode, and a story moment all at once.

## **The Vision of the Project**

Long-term development includes:

* **Item-bound HUD profiles** (different goggles = different AR themes)
* **Transmog-detected visor styles**
* **Toy/buff-based overlays**
* **Skin variants per race/class fantasy**
* **More advanced reticle logic**
* **Better editing tools and calibration systems**

PersonaEngine AR HUD is a **work in progress**, evolving fast with new code, new toys, and new ways to blend immersion with functionality.

## **Why It’s Fun**

Because it makes UI a *character trait*.

Your visor is a piece of gear.
Your readouts are inventions.
Your awareness is earned, not granted.

It’s WoW with a layer of sci-fantasy engineering stitched directly onto your field of view, making every fight feel like your character is inside their own custom HUD system.
